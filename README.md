# type-single-page
 In this project I learned how to be using css grid and heirarchy, I picked Science Gothic because it was most simular to the font I used on my buisness card project. I spent the a lot of time on making the background graphic and font weight slider. After that I played with different hover animations, and for the expand animation I wanted it to only effect the top row of letters, but it wouldn't work. I also had the sidebar be in a fixed position so you could always access it. What I spent the most time on was making the grid with each of the letters in it, they kept being uneaven so I kept toggling the left margin and right margins and there still uneven now. A cool thing I learned that to make any element editable you can just set contenteditable to true in the html. I wish I included numbers, the numbers are one of the coolest parts of the font.
